## Dimensions

Couldn't find dimensions on the interwebs that were priced at a point I was willing to pay (e.g. $1k).  So...  I burned cash and time buying and learning to use a scanner, littering the panels reflective marker dots...  Removing the DOTs will be a PITA.

- $320 [3D scanner](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CNVQGVMM)
  - Came with ~400 dots
  - Dancing with the Wired Scanner is PITA.  Note there's a $160 [Wireless upgrade kit](Wireless Scanning Kit), consider using if do lots of large scans.
- $17 [Qty 600, 6.0mm 3D Scanning Marker dot reference points](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09Q86JP3Q)
  - Adhesive on these retroreflective dots is really sticky, much harder to remove than the dots that came with the Creality Ferret SE scanner.  Very time consuming to remove!
