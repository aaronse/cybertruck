## Dimensions

Couldn't find dimensions on the interwebs that were priced at a point I was willing to pay (e.g. saw prices in $1k range for detailed scans).  So...  Decided to burn cash and time buying and learning to use a 3D scanner, littering the panels with reflective marker dots...  Removing the dots will be a PITA.  Previously used, and still have a PC connected Kinect 3D scanner.  Hardware/software has advanced.  My current setup... 

- $320 [3D scanner](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CNVQGVMM)
  - Came with ~400 dots
  - Dancing with the Wired Scanner is PITA.  Note there's a $160 [Creality 3D Scanner CR-Scan Ferret Wireless Scanning Kit, WiFi6 Wireless Bridge](https://www.amazon.com/Creality-Wireless-Kit-Indicators-Consumption/dp/B0D1Y8GW55), consider using if do lots of large scans.
- $17 [Qty 600, 6.0mm 3D Scanning Marker dot reference points](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09Q86JP3Q)
  - Adhesive on these retroreflective dots is really sticky, much harder to remove than the dots that came with the Creality Ferret SE scanner.  Very time consuming to remove!

Assuming (?) actual dimensions haven't changed, maybe these can be used to help calibrate/refine/validate 3D scanned models.
